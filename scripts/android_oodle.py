# Unreal Engine shaders decoded with the game's own Oodle on the phone, for build_android_from_nsp.py on a computer that cannot run the game's code.
# An Unreal game's shaders are Oodle-compressed (Octopath Traveler 0: each shader in its paks' shader code archives; FINAL FANTASY RESONANCE: its IoStore container's blocks and
# each shader group), and only the decoder statically linked into main undoes it (dm/host/hle_oodle.c). The NSP scripts run it in the Mac host; a Windows or Linux PC cannot run
# the game's arm64 code, but the phone can: the game's Android host runs the same job (DM_OODLE_JOB, before nnMain, then it exits), with only the game's rewritten code on the
# phone (no RomFS: the job reads none). FINAL FANTASY RESONANCE's decoded shader group matched the Mac's archive byte for byte (35 of 35 shaders, OnePlus Pad 3).
# A job is one launch of the game, so the decodes uepak.py asks for one at a time are batched (Rounds): uepak runs with a decoder that answers from what the phone decoded so far
# and records the rest, the records go to the phone as one job, and uepak runs again until it asks for nothing new. An IoStore container takes two or three rounds (its blocks,
# then the shader groups inside them).
